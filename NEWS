Lunch release notes
===================

Version 0.5.0 - 2012-07-25
--------------------------
This is the first developer release in the 0.5 unstable series. That means it might introduces changes that are not backward-compatible and that its API might change in the future release s within the 0.5 series.

New features: 
* add utils/make-tarball.sh
* update INSTALL with setup.py instructions

Bug fixes: 
* Change logging and PID file directory to /tmp (it was not working at all when used by many users on the same host)
* add Michal Seta to authors in about dialog


Version 0.4.2 - 2011-12-12
--------------------------
This is the second stable release of the 0.4 stable branch. That means we have done a feature freeze and chosen an API that will stay througout the next releases in the 0.4 branch.

This release introduces a few bug fixes and little improvements in the documentation.

New features: 
* Explain add_command() and add_local_address() in the man page
* Switch to even-only micro release numbers

Bug fixes: 
* Fix project URL
* Catch "Host key verification failed" SSH error


Version 0.4.0 - 2010-09-02
--------------------------
This is the first stable release of the 0.4 stable branch. That means we have done a feature freeze and chosen an API that will stay througout the next releases in the 0.4 branch. 

Lunch 0.4 has an API that is slightly different than Lunch in the 0.2 series. Among the most important changes is the deprecation of the "title" keyword of the "add_command" function in favour of the "identifier" one. Same applies for "sleep" in favour of "sleep_after". The "priority", "order" and "log_file" keywords are also deprecated. 

Lunch can now be used as a library to spawn processes from a Python application. The lunch-slave script must be installed on every host on which the operator wants to launch processes.

New features: 
* (none)

Bug fixes: 
* Fixed typo in an example
* Try to not show "no route to host" more than once
* more verbose when killing a running master
* Improved the doc about ssh-agent

* master: Use on_* callbacks style for the Slave Process Manager as well.
* master: Use send_* methods style for the senders on both side.
* master: The order of commands should be automatically ordered with calling order.
* master: Dependencies: when one slave dies, kill all slaves who depend on it, restart them all again - if needed.
* master: Wait for the greetings message, not the connection to the process stdin.
* slave: Make sure each process is dead. Poll with a timer and use signals if needed.
* slave: use a kill_delay option, with a default of 1.0 second.
* master: Separate log for each slave on the master's side.
